  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement focuses on designing websites that follow specific web standards that allow for content to be made available to all browsers and all devices without any performance issues. Unlike Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement makes sure to include all browsers ,no matter how outdated they are, in new updates. Progressive enhancement allows for content to be made available to all people no matter what their situation is. It makes sure that everyone is receiving the same quality of content.Progressive enhancement is important because it allows for better web design. It focuses on getting the content out to the public and making sure that it is available and accessible for everyone.I found an interesting article detailing the importance of progressive enhancment in todays society and why everyone should be on board with following web standards.<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/progressive-enhancement-and-standards-do-not-limit-web-design/">link to second article.</a></p>
  <h2>Dragon Project revision and reflection Assignment</h2>
  <p>I went into this class blindly.I didn't know anything relating to web design before this semester.I was very intimidated at the beginning because it is a lot of information to learn in a short amount of time but I found that the assignments and projects were really helpful and provided hands-on learning.I was the best at html and struggled the worst with css,javascript and path finding.</p>
  <p>The final project was really intimidating, I was worried that I would not have captured the skills needed during the semester. I surprised myself once I did start putting everything together. I definitely underestimated how long it was going to take me to complete the first draft. It took me almost an entire week. I learned that a lot of time definitely needs to be set aside when starting a project. I did run into some errors but those errors allowed me to learn to think critically. When working on my final project a lot of time was spent figuring out proper paths.If I could start over, I would go back and take written notes after every class, I only took notes a couple times but those few times that I took notes I noticed I had a better understanding of the material. I learned that I'm a kinesthetic learner and that I benefit from engaging with the material.</p>
  <p>For the revised version of the final I added some javascript and addressed the recommendations I received from my family. My mom struggles with being farsighted and vocalized the fact that it was difficult for her to read the questions on the faq page because there was too much going on. I removed the italic font style, I was also going to remove the underline text decoration but I decided to keep it because it lets users know the questions are clickable links. I also went back and fixed anything that I wasn't happy with.</p>
  <p>I hope to expand my skills with the information I have learned this semester by continuing to practice.</p>
